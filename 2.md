NOVACOMET is a large-scale, open commonsense model that can handle both explicit knowledge generation, and tasks that require commonsense reasoning.


NOVACOMET is trained with symbolic knowledge distillation (West et al., 2021) by combining the commonsense data generated by large language models (ยง2.1) with high-quality annotations
of knowledge plausibility (ยง2.2). We experiment
with multiple methods for combining generated
data with plausibility information (indicating how
likely a given knowledge is) to train the final model,
NOVACOMET (ยง2.3).
