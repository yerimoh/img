In general, parsing natural language is a
challenging problem, due to ambiguities that mean a single
sentence can sometimes be parsed in multiple different ways to
produce different meanings. In practice, the formulaic and
precise nature of the chemistry literature means that this occurs
less often, and parsing to a level that is adequate for information
extraction is much more tractable than in other domains.


The ChemicalTagger project pioneered the use of a rulebased
grammar for parsing experimental synthesis sections of
chemistry texts. Their strategy was to attempt to build one
universal grammar to parse all possible inputs, but this was
pushing at the practical limits of a single rule-based grammar,
even within their relatively narrow target domain.


Our alternative strategy is to make use of multiple, more
specialized grammars that are tailored to extracting more
specific types of chemical information. Similarly to ChemicalTagger,
our system produces input for the parser in the
form of a merged list of tags from the part-of-speech tagger and
chemical entity recognizer. Each grammar consists of a series of
nested rules that describe how sequences of tagged tokens can
be translated into a tree model that represents the syntactic
structure of each sentence. Grammars are defined in simple
Python code, and unlike other tools, they do not need to be
compiled before use.


Figure 5a shows a simplified grammar, which recognizes
definitions of alphanumeric compound labels in terms of a full
chemical name. The rules are primarily constructed using three
core elements: T, which matches a token based on its POS or
entity tag, W, which matches the exact text of a token, and R,
which matches text patterns using regular expressions. The +
operator is used to define a required sequence of tokens, while
the | operator is used where just one of multiple alternatives is
required. Additional elements such as Optional, ZeroOrMore,
and Not allow more complex rules to be
constructed.




In the example grammar shown in Figure 5a, the first rule,
name, matches a token with the tag B-CM, followed by zero or
more tokens with the tag I-CM, corresponding to the output
tags of the chemical named entity recognizer. The second rule,
label, defines two regular expression patterns, one for
alphanumeric labels and one for Roman numerals, either of
which may be matched. The final rule, cem, is defined in terms
of the first two rules. It requires a name, followed by a label
enclosed within brackets. Figure 5b shows an illustration of the
tree data structure that results from applying this grammar to
an example sentence.
