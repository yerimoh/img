Table 4 presents an evaluation of
ChemDataExtractor’s ability to extract the names and
alphanumeric labels of chemical entities in a document. Any
identifier that is present in public chemical databases or is
resolvable using IUPAC naming rules is considered a name,
while all other identifiers that are typically only applicable
within the context of the containing document are considered
labels.



Chemical name extraction is primarily dependent on the
performance of the underlying chemical named entity
recognizers, while extraction of labels depends on their
proximity to a recognized chemical name or their presence
within a table.






An F-score of 93.4% was obtained when considering
chemical records as a whole, reflecting ChemDataExtractor’s
ability to identify which names and alphanumeric labels
correspond to the same chemical entity. Accurately matching
alphanumeric labels to the relevant chemical name is a vital
prerequisite to successfully extracting any spectra and properties
that are defined solely in terms of a label.


Spectroscopic Attributes.


An evaluation of ChemDataExtractor’s
ability to extract various spectroscopic attributes is
shown in Table 5. As well as assessing the extraction of each
individual spectrum attribute, the extraction of overall spectrum
records is presented.



Precision is consistently high across all attributes, and some
even have no false positives at all within the test set. This is due
to the rule-based nature of the parsers in ChemDataExtractor,
which are well-suited to the formulaic language and structure of
scientific articles that leave little room for misinterpretation.


Contextual spectroscopic attributes such as temperature and
apparatus present the greatest challenge in terms of resolving
interdependencies between information that has been extracted
from different document domains. For example, a spectrum
may have peaks listed in a table, temperature mentioned in a
figure caption, and apparatus mentioned in the main text,
leading to the slightly lower recall values of 87.5% and 91.0%
for temperature and apparatus, respectively. The ability to
accurately match together these disparate pieces of information
is a unique strength of ChemDataExtractor, yet also presents
the greatest opportunity for further improvement.
