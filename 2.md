Part-of-Speech-Tagging. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging
involves assigning a tag to each token that describes its
syntactic function, for example as a noun, verb or adjective.
Entity recognition, phrase parsing, and information extraction
tools routinely use the POS tags on tokens as part of their
input, and thus their success is often highly dependent on the
accuracy of the tagging process.
The vast majority of publicly available natural language
processing tools provide POS taggers that have been trained on
newspaper articles, and therefore do not necessarily perform
well on chemistry literature. Tsuruoka et al.4 found that by
training a POS tagger on a combined corpus of newspaper
articles (WSJ corpus28) and MEDLINE abstracts (GENIA
corpus29), performance in the biomedical domain was greatly
improved. In the absence of any equivalent POS-annotated
corpus that covers the wider chemistry domain, the POS tagger
in our system makes use of the same newspaper and biomedical
training corpora but also supplements these with unsupervised
word cluster features derived from chemistry articles. This
improves performance across a wider range of subject areas and
document domains (such as captions) that are not well-covered
by the training corpora.
The POS tagger uses a linear-chain conditional random field
(CRF) model, trained using the orthant-wise limited-memory
quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) method as implemented by the
CRFsuite framework.30 The features for each token are shown
in Table 1. The word shape feature is derived by replacing every
number with “d”, every greek letter with “g”, and every latin
letter with “X” or “x” for uppercase and lowercase, respectively.
