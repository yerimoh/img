One promising approach to enhance the adaptability
of PLMs is to expand the coverage of vocabulary.
For example, previous works have expanded
the vocabulary of PLMs by considering
the frequency information of downstream datasets
(Hong et al., 2021; Yao et al., 2021). However,
such a frequency-based approach can be suboptimal
in materials science, as downstream datasets
in this domain are typically scarce and limited in
coverage (Song et al., 2023). Indeed, we experimentally
observe that a strong optimization method
(i.e., AVocaDo (Hong et al., 2021)) underperforms
the model without vocabulary expansion2. Figure
1 illustrates that AVocaDo yields poor adaptation
results in materials science, while significantly enhancing
the performance of PLMs in other domains
(e.g., biomedical, computer science, politics), underscoring
the unique challenges of adaptation to
the materials science domain.
