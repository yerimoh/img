• We introduce online cascade learning, a new framework
for learning model cascades in resource-intensive streaming analytics settings. The framework enables systematic
trade-offs between prediction accuracy and resource usage, and allows learning without any human annotations.


• We offer a formulation of the online learning of cascades
in terms of episodic MDPs and give a no-regret imitation
learning method for solving this problem.


• We present rigorous experiments showing that our proposed algorithm can achieve comparable accuracy as
LLMs while saving up to 90% of the inference costs. Our
source code is available at https://github.com/
