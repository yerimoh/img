First, we have experts generate 21 varied prompts to steer models to generate events or situations that require commonsense knowledge to fully understand (see B.1 for
all prompts used). As variations in prompt wording
influence the modelâ€™s output, we use many different
prompts to enhance both diversity and coverage of
the generated outputs. Half of the time, we generate
contexts in a zero-shot manner, while for the other
half, we do one-shot generation with one example
drawn from ATOMIC10X (West et al., 2022). In
order to reduce generation cost, we generate 20
situations per prompt (batched generation).


We generate the contexts using GPT-3 (Brown
et al., 2020) variant text-davinci-003 (Ouyang
et al., 2022) for a total cost of USD $39.56. We set
top_p=0.99 and presence_penalty=0.3, lowering the logit values for tokens that have already
occurred to promote diversity within each batch.
Finally, to allow NOVACOMET to see some diversity of names, we also randomly swap all entities (names or "PersonX/Y/Z") for a name drawn
from the 2021 public US social security application
name registry2 with probability 0.5.
