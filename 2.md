Table 1
shows the comparisons of NOVATOMIC to existing CSKGs, ATOMIC2020 (Hwang et al., 2020) and
ATOMIC10X (West et al., 2022) in dataset statistics and lexical diversity measures. NOVATOMIC
contains more diverse unique premises (heads) and
hypotheses (tails) as indicated by the higher number and/or percentage of these data entries. NOVATOMIC also has higher lexical variations, as reflected by the significantly more diverse 3-grams.
In particular, as NOVATOMIC breaks out from
fixed relation types with open questions to connect
premise and hypothesis, it contains much more
diverse and flexible sets of relations denoted by
natural language questions.


It is also of note that, based on estimates from
(West et al., 2022), the total cost of ATOMIC2020
and ATOMIC10X were approximately USD
$40,000 and USD $6,000 respectively, whereas
the cost for NOVATOMIC is approximately $400.
Though the size of NOVATOMIC is somewhat
smaller, the unit cost per example is also significantly lower.
