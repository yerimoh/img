Overall performance was evaluated by applying
ChemDataExtractor to a test collection of 50 open-access
chemistry articles that were selected from journals published by
the ACS, RSC, and Springer. The precision, recall and F-score
for the extraction of various different kinds of information were
calculated by comparing ChemDataExtractor’s output with a
gold standard output36 that was manually compiled especially
for this evaluation. Strict guidelines were developed to ensure
manual extraction was performed consistently.




Chemical entities, spectra, and properties were extracted
from the abstract, main text, tables, and figure captions. For this
evaluation, extraction of melting point, oxidation and reduction
potentials, photoluminescence lifetime, and quantum yield
properties was considered, as well as NMR, UV−vis, and IR
spectroscopic attributes. The relevant chemical entities were
restricted to those with associated spectra or properties, or with
an assigned alphanumeric label. All information that is defined
solely within a scheme or figure image or a separate Supporting
Information document was considered outside the scope of our
system and was therefore excluded from the evaluation.




Table 3 presents the overall precision, recall, and F-score
values for the extraction of chemical identifiers, spectroscopic
attributes, and chemical properties. These evaluation metrics
consider the extraction of an entire data record as an individual
unit, as shown by the schema diagram in Figure 8. A record is
considered a false negative if any part of the record is missing, a
false positive if any part of the record is incorrect, and a true
positive only if it is exactly correct.


The following sections present a more detailed evaluation of
the individual components that make up each of the record
types in Table 3.
