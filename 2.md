Due to the wide variety of methods with differing strengths,
our approach is to provide a modular architecture for named
entity recognition that allows the results from multiple
methodologies to be combined using heuristic techniques.
We primarily use a CRF-based recognizer for chemical names,
in combination with a dictionary-based recognizer that provides
improved performance for trivial and trade names, and a regular
expression-based recognizer that excels for database identifiers
and chemical formulas.



The dictionary-based recognizer uses a word list compiled
from the Jochem chemical dictionary34 with an automatic
filtering process based on the method described by Lowe and
Sayle14 that excludes entries that lead to false positives. For
efficient storage and fast string matching, the dictionary is
stored as a directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), which uses a
graph-like representation to eliminate redundancy between
similar names.'


The CRF-based recognizer uses a linear-chain CRF model,
trained using the OWL-QN method as implemented by the
CRFsuite framework.30 The features that are generated for each
token are listed in Table 2. An “IOB” labeling scheme was
utilized, where each token is labeled as the beginning of a
chemical name (B), in a chemical name (I), or outside a
chemical name (O). Training was performed using the training
subset of the CHEMDNER corpus and the word clusters
derived from chemistry articles.
