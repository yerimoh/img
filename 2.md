Chemical Properties.


Table 6 presents the precision, recall,
and F-score for the extraction of different aspects of chemical
property information, as well as the overall property record.


Errors in property extraction typically occur where properties
are reported in sentences within the main text, rather than in a
table. In these cases, while the value and units are normally
extracted without issue, complex sentence structures often
result in a failure to assign a chemical subject. Errors in
extraction from tables also occasionally arise from complex
table structures; for example where some table cells are merged
across multiple rows or columns, as this can introduce
ambiguity around the exact scope of the cell contents.
