Of the many forest plants that can cause poisoning, wild
mushrooms may be among the most dangerous. ① This is
because people sometimes confuse the poisonous and edible
varieties, or they eat mushrooms without making a positive
identification of the variety. ② Many people enjoy hunting
wild species of mushrooms in the spring season, because
they are excellent edible mushrooms and are highly prized.
③However, some wild mushrooms are dangerous, leading people
to lose their lives due to mushroom poisoning. ④Growing a
high­quality product at a reasonable cost is a key aspect to
farming edible mushrooms for profit. ⑤To be safe, a person
must be able to identify edible mushrooms before eating any
wild one.
