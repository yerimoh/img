Given the widespread use of emoticons in electronic
communication, an important question is whether they help
Internet users to understand emotions in online
communication. ① Emoticons, particularly character‒based
ones, are much more ambiguous relative to face‒to‒face cues
and may end up being interpreted very differently by
different users. ② Nonetheless, research indicates that they
are useful tools in online text‒based communication. ③ One
study of 137 instant messaging users revealed that
emoticons allowed users to correctly understand the level
and direction of emotion, attitude, and attention expression
and that emoticons were a definite advantage in non‒verbal
communication. ④ In fact, there have been few studies on
the relationships between verbal and nonverbal communication.
⑤ Similarly, another study showed that emoticons were
useful in strengthening the intensity of a verbal message, as
well as in the expression of sarcasm
