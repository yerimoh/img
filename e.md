Studying history can make you more knowledgeable or
interesting to talk to or can lead to all sorts of brilliant
vocations, explorations, and careers. ① But even more
importantly, studying history helps us ask and answer
humanity’s Big Questions. ② If you want to know why
something is happening in the present, you might ask a
sociologist or an economist. ③ But if you want to know
deep background, you ask historians. ④ A career as a
historian is a rare job, which is probably why you have
never met one. ⑤ That’s because they are the people who
know and understand the past and can explain its complex
interrelationships with the present.
