Wouldn’t it be nice if you could take your customers by the
hand and guide each one through your store while pointing out
all the great products you would like them to consider buying?
① Most people, however, would not particularly enjoy
having a stranger grab their hand and drag them through a
store. ② Rather, let the store do it for you. ③ Have a central
path that leads shoppers through the store and lets them look at
many different departments or product areas. ④ You can use
this effect of music on shopping behavior by playing it in the
store. ⑤ This path leads your customers from the entrance
through the store on the route you want them to take all the
way to the checkout.
