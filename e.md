Words like ‘near’ and ‘far’ can mean different things
depending on where you are and what you are doing. If you
were at a zoo, then you might say you are ‘near’ an animal
if you could reach out and touch it through the bars of its
cage. ① Here the word ‘near’ means an arm’s length away.
② If you were telling someone how to get to your local
shop, you might call it ‘near’ if it was a five­minute walk
away. ③ It seems that you had better walk to the shop to
improve your health. ④ Now the word ‘near’ means much
longer than an arm’s length away. ⑤ Words like ‘near’, ‘far’,
‘small’, ‘big’, ‘hot’, and ‘cold’ all mean different things to
different people at different times.
