Paying attention to some people and not others doesn’t
mean you’re being dismissive or arrogant. ① It just reflects
a hard fact: there are limits on the number of people we
can possibly pay attention to or develop a relationship
with. ② Some scientists even believe that the number of
people with whom we can continue stable social relationships
might be limited naturally by our brains. ③ The more people
you know of different backgrounds, the more colorful your
life becomes. ④ Professor Robin Dunbar has explained that
our minds are only really capable of forming meaningful
relationships with a maximum of about a hundred and fifty
people. ⑤ Whether that’s true or not, it’s safe to assume
that we can’t be real friends with everyone
