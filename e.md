Public speaking is audience centered because speakers
“listen” to their audiences during speeches. They monitor
audience feedback, the verbal and nonverbal signals an
audience gives a speaker. ① Audience feedback often
indicates whether listeners understand, have interest in, and
are ready to accept the speaker’s ideas. ② This feedback
assists the speaker in many ways. ③ It helps the speaker
know when to slow down, explain something more carefully,
or even tell the audience that she or he will return to an
issue in a question­and­answer session at the close of the
speech. ④ It is important for the speaker to memorize his or
her script to reduce on­stage anxiety. ⑤ Audience feedback
assists the speaker in creating a respectful connection with
the audience.
