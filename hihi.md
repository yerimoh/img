“Processing-structure-property-performance” is the key mantra in Materials
Science and Engineering (MSE) [1]. The length and time scales of material
structures and phenomena vary significantly among these four elements, adding
further complexity [2]. For instance, structural information can range from
detailed knowledge of atomic coordinates of elements to the microscale spatial
distribution of phases (microstructure), to fragment connectivity (mesoscale),
to images and spectra. Establishing linkages between the above components is
a challenging task.



Both experimental and computational techniques are useful to identify
such relationships. Due to rapid growth in automation in experimental equipments and immense expansion of computational resources, the size of public
materials datasets has seen an exponential growth. Through the Materials
Genome Initiative (MGI) [3] and the increasing adoption of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) [4] principles, several large experimental
and computational datasets have been developed [5–12]. Such an outburst of
data requires automated analysis which can be facilitated by machine-learning
(ML) techniques [13–20].




Deep learning (DL) [21, 22] is a specialized branch of machine learning
(ML). Originally inspired by biological models of computation and cognition
in the human brain [23, 24], one of DL’s major strengths is its potential to
extract higher-level features from the raw input data.


DL applications are rapidly replacing conventional systems in many aspects
of our daily lives as, for example, in image and speech recognition, web search,
fraud detection, email/spam filtering, financial risk modeling, and so on. DL
techniques have been proven to provide exciting new capabilities in numerous
fields (such as playing Go [25], self-driving cars [26], navigation, chip design,
particle physics, protein science, drug discovery, astrophysics, object recognition
[27], etc)


Recently DL methods have been outperforming other machine learning
techniques in numerous scientific fields, such as chemistry, physics, biology, and
materials science [20, 28–32]. DL applications in MSE are still relatively new,
and the field has not fully explored its potential, implications, and limitations.
DL provides new approaches for investigating material phenomena and has
pushed materials scientists to expand their traditional toolset.
