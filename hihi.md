34. It is common to assume that creativity concerns primarily the
relation between actor(creator) and artifact(creation). However,
from a sociocultural standpoint, the creative act is never “complete”
in the absence of a second position―that of an audience. While
the actor or creator him/herself is the first audience of the
artifact being produced, this kind of distantiation can only be
achieved by . This means that, in order to be an audience to your own
creation, a history of interaction with others is needed. We
exist in a social world that constantly confronts us with the
“view of the other.” It is the view we include and blend into
our own activity, including creative activity. This outside
perspective is essential for creativity because it gives new
meaning and value to the creative act and its product. [3점]

* artifact: 창작물    
① exploring the absolute truth in existence    

② following a series of precise and logical steps

③ looking outside and drawing inspiration from nature

④ internalizing the perspective of others on one’s work

⑤ pushing the audience to the limits of its endurance

33. What do advertising and map­making have in common?
Without doubt the best answer is their shared need to
communicate a limited version of the truth. An
advertisement must create an image that’s appealing and a
map must present an image that’s clear, but neither can
meet its goal by . Ads will cover
up or play down negative aspects of the company or service
they advertise. In this way, they can promote a favorable
comparison with similar products or differentiate a product
from its competitors. Likewise, the map must remove details
that would be confusing. [3점]

① reducing the amount of information

② telling or showing everything

③ listening to people’s voices

④ relying on visual images only

⑤ making itself available to everyone

33. Recently I was with a client who had spent almost five
hours with me. As we were parting for the evening, we
reflected on what we had covered that day. Even though our
conversation was very collegial, I noticed that my client was
holding one leg at a right angle to his body, seemingly
wanting to take off on its own. At that point I said, “You
really do have to leave now, don’t you?” “Yes,” he admitted.
“I am so sorry. I didn’t want to be rude but I have to call
London and I only have five minutes!” Here was a case
where my client’s language and most of his body revealed
nothing but positive feelings. His feet, however, were
 , and they clearly told me
that as much as he wanted to stay, duty was calling. [3점]

* collegial: 평등하게 책임을 지는

① a signal of his politeness

② the subject of the conversation

③ expressing interest in my words

④ the most honest communicators

⑤ stepping excitedly onto the grou

33. As much as we can learn by examining fossils, it is
important to remember that they seldom . Things only fossilize under certain sets of conditions. Modern
insect communities are highly diverse in tropical forests, but
the recent fossil record captures little of that diversity. Many
creatures are consumed entirely or decompose rapidly when
they die, so there may be no fossil record at all for important
groups. It’s a bit similar to a family photo album. Maybe when
you were born your parents took lots of pictures, but over the
years they took photographs occasionally, and sometimes they
got busy and forgot to take pictures at all. Very few of us have a complete photo record of our life. Fossils are just like that.
Sometimes you get very clear pictures of the past, while at
other times there are big gaps, and you need to notice what
they are. [3점]

* decompose: 부패하다

① tell the entire story

② require further study

③ teach us a wrong lesson

④ change their original traits

⑤ make room for imagination

34. One real concern in the marketing industry today is how
to in the
age of the remote control and mobile devices. With the
growing popularity of digital video recorders, consumers can
mute, fast-forward, and skip over commercials entirely.
Some advertisers are trying to adapt to these technologies,
by planting hidden coupons in frames of their television
commercials. Others are desperately trying to make their
advertisements more interesting and entertaining to
discourage viewers from skipping their ads; still others are
simply giving up on television advertising altogether. Some
industry experts predict that cable providers and advertisers
will eventually be forced to provide incentives in order to
encourage consumers to watch their messages. These
incentives may come in the form of coupons, or a reduction
in the cable bill for each advertisement watched. [3점]

* mute: 음소거하다

① guide people to be wise consumers

② reduce the cost of television advertising

③ keep a close eye on the quality of products

④ make it possible to deliver any goods any time

⑤ win the battle for broadcast advertising exposure

34. If you ask a physicist how long it would take a marble to
fall from the top of a ten­story building, he will likely answer
the question by assuming that the marble falls in a vacuum.
In reality, the building is surrounded by air, which applies
friction to the falling marble and slows it down. Yet the
physicist will point out that the friction on the marble is so
small that its effect is negligible. Assuming the marble falls in
a vacuum simplifies the problem without substantially affecting
the answer. Economists make assumptions for the same
reason: Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make
it easier to understand. To study the effects of international
trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists
of only two countries and that each country produces only two
goods. By doing so, we can _________________________________. Thus, we are in a better position to understand international
trade in the complex world. [3점]

 * negligible: 무시할 수 있는
 
 ① prevent violations of consumer rights
 
 ② understand the value of cultural diversity
 
 ③ guarantee the safety of experimenters in labs
 
 ④ focus our thinking on the essence of the problem
 
 ⑤ realize the differences between physics and economics

32. We have to recognize that there always exists in us the
strongest need to utilize all our attention. And this is
quite evident in the great amount of displeasure we feel
any time the entirety of our capacity for attention is not
being put to use. When this is the case, we will seek
 . If we are playing a
chess game with a weaker opponent, we will seek to
supplement this activity with another: such as watching TV, or
listening to music, or playing another chess game at the same
time. Very often this reveals itself in unconscious movements,
such as playing with something in one’s hands or pacing around
the room; and if such an action also serves to increase
pleasure or relieve displeasure, all the better. * supplement: 보충하다

① to please others with what we are good at

② to pay more attention to the given task

③ to find outlets for our unused attention

④ to play with a stronger opponent

⑤ to give our brain a short break

34. We like to make a show of how much our decisions are based
on rational considerations, but the truth is that we are largely
governed by our emotions, which continually influence our
perceptions. What this means is that the people around you,
constantly under the pull of their emotions, change their ideas
by the day or by the hour, depending on their mood. You must
never assume that what people say or do in a particular moment
is a statement of their permanent desires. Yesterday they were
in love with your idea; today they seem cold. This will confuse
you and if you are not careful, you will waste valuable mental
space trying to figure out their real feelings, their mood of the
moment, and their fleeting motivations. It is best to
from their shifting
emotions so that you are not caught up in the process. [3점]

* fleeting: 빨리 지나가는

① cultivate both distance and a degree of detachment

② find out some clues or hints to their occupation

③ learn to be more empathetic for them

④ discover honesty in their character

⑤ relieve their anxiety and worries
