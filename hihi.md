A very active area of materials research is to devise methods that use machine learning to automatically extract predictive models
from existing materials data. While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for some applications, many more
applications exist where machine learning can make a strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based
models for such applications, we have created a framework capable of being applied to a broad range of materials data. Our
method works by using a chemically diverse list of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide variety of
properties, and a novel method for partitioning the data set into groups of similar materials to boost the predictive accuracy. In this
manuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse properties of crystalline and amorphous
materials, such as band gap energy and glass-forming ability.
