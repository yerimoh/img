we present a high-level overview of deep-learning methods followed by a
detailed discussion of recent developments of deep learning in atomistic
simulation, materials imaging, spectral analysis, and natural language
processing. For each modality we discuss applications involving both theoretical and experimental data, typical modeling approaches with their
strengths and limitations, and relevant publicly available software and
datasets. We conclude the review with a discussion of recent cross-cutting
work related to uncertainty quantification in this field and a brief perspective on limitations, challenges, and potential growth areas for DL methods
in materials science. The application of DL methods in materials science
presents an exciting avenue for future materials discovery and design.
