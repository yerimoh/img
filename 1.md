The observed benefits of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the
same performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting. Figure 5 shows an
ablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.



Equation only. 

One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the
mathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted
to output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer. Figure 5 shows that equation
only prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions
in GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language
reasoning steps in chain of thought. For datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we find
that equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived
from the question (see Appendix Table 6).

Variable compute only

Another intuition is that chain of
thought allows the model to spend more computation (i.e.,
intermediate tokens) on harder problems. To isolate the effect
of variable computation from chain-of-thought reasoning, we
test a configuration where the model is prompted to output a
only sequence of dots (. . .) equal to the number of characters in
the equation needed to solve the problem. This variant performs
about the same as the baseline, which suggests that variable
computation by itself is not the reason for the success of chainof-thought prompting, and that there appears to be utility from
expressing intermediate steps via natural language.


Chain of thought after answer


Another potential benefit of
chain-of-thought prompting could simply be that such prompts
allow the model to better access relevant knowledge acquired
during pretraining. Therefore, we test an alternative configuration where the chain of thought prompt is only given after the
answer, isolating whether the model actually depends on the
produced chain of thought to give the final answer. This variant
performs about the same as the baseline, which suggests that
the sequential reasoning embodied in the chain of thought is
useful for reasons beyond just activating knowledge
