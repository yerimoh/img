We now analyze our corpus and provide detailed
corpus statistics. In total, there are 46,351 NE
annotations. Table 3 shows the counts by NE label. There are roughly 1.5 MAT annotations per
sentence as these are nested and occurrences of
composite materials often result in many combined
MAT tags. Table 4 reports the counts of annotated relations (16,794 in total), with hasForm as
the most frequent relation with 2910 instances and
dopedBy the least frequent with only 65 instances.
Out of all 10186 sentences, 2111 (20.7%) describe a measurement (i.e., they contain at least one
MEASUREMENT annotation). On average, each
document contains 43.4 MEASUREMENT annotations. In addition, there are 1476 sentences (14.5%)
marked as containing a QUAL_MEAS, with 40 sentences of these also containing a MEASUREMENT
annotation.
