The rationale of the pooling layer is to further abstract the features generated from the convolutional
layer by aggregating the scores for each filter to introduce the invariance to the absolute positions but
preserve the relative positions of the n-grams between themselves and the entity heads at the same
time. The popular aggregating function is max as
it bears responsibility for identifying the most important or relevant features from the score sequence.
Concretely, for each filter f, its score sequence s is
passed through the max function to produce a single
number: pf = max{s} = max{s1, s2, . . . snâˆ’w+1}
which can be interpreted as estimating the possibility some augmented n-gram of the hidden class of f
appears in the context.
