We model the task of classifying whether
a sentence contains a MEASUREMENT or a
QUAL_MEAS annotation as a ternary sentence classification task, i.e., it is also possible that a sentence
does not refer to any measurement. As we are primarily interested in detecting MEASUREMENT, we
map the few multi-label cases carrying both positive labels to MEASUREMENT. We use a linear
layer plus softmax with the CLS token embedding
as input. For training, we downsample the amount
of non-measurement sentences.
