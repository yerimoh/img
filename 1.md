We analyze numerous composition tables in
MatSci research papers (see Figures 1, 6 and 4 for
examples), and find that the task has several facets,
with many table styles for similar compositions.
We now describe the key challenges involved in
the task of composition extraction from tables.

• Distractor rows and columns: Additional
information such as material properties, molar
ratios, and std errors in the same table. E.g., in
Figure 1a, the last three rows are distractor rows.


• Orientation of tables: Table shown in Figure 4a
is a row oriented table—different compositions are
written in different rows. The table in Figure 1a is
a column-oriented table.

• Different units: Compositions can be in different
units such as mol%, weight%, mol fraction, weight
fraction. Some tables express composition in both
molar and mass units.

• Material IDs: Authors refer to different
materials in their publication by assigning them
unique IDs. These material IDs may not be
specified every time, (e.g., Fig. 1c).

• Single-cell compositions (SCC): In Fig. 1a, all
compositions are present in multiple table cells.
Some authors report the entire composition in a
single table cell, as shown in Fig. 1c.

• Percentages exceeding 100: Sum of coefficients
may exceed 100, and re-normalization is needed.
A common case is when a dopant is used; its
amount is reported in excess.

• Percentages as variables: Contributions of
constituents may be expressed using variables like
x, y. In Fig. 6 (see App. A), x represents the mol%
of (GeBr4) and the 2nd row contains its value.

• Partial-information tables: It is also common
to have percentages of only some constituents
in the table; the remaining composition is to be
inferred based on paper text or table caption, e.g.,
Figure 1b. Another example: if the paper is on
silicate glasses, then SiO2 is assumed.

• Other corner cases: There are several other
corner cases like percentages missing from the
table, compounds with variables (e.g., R2O in the
header; the value of R to be inferred from material
ID), and highly unusual placement of information
(some examples in appendix).
